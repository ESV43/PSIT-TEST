Several events and a symposium were conducted throughout the week. The activities reached more than about 6,500 people through social media with a total of 26.4 thousand impressions, and around 320 participants from different institutes actively participated in various activities. The hon’ble Director of our institute, Prof J N Moorthy, inaugurated the celebrations. He appreciated the organisers' efforts in conducting the activities throughout the year, highlighting the importance of such activities in the overall development of the active environment at the institute.<br><br></p><h3>Symposium</h3>Three awardees of the Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar Prize delivered online webinars spanning broad domains of physics. More than 200 participants, including faculty from IISER TVM, attended the lectures. On 25th January 2022, Dr Kanak Saha spoke about the extreme-UV photons from the AstroSat UV Deep Field. He described the transformation of the universe from a neutral state to an ionized one and how UV photons are believed to be responsible for this. He also reported the first discovery of a high-redshift galaxy emitting extreme UV photons. On 27th January 2022, Dr Aninda Sinha delivered a webinar about quantum field theory without Feynman diagrams. He spoke about the bootstrap approach that was formulated in the 1960s but has been popularised over the last decade. He also discussed how century-old mathematics relying on the so-called Bieberbach conjecture gives rise to constraints on low energy physics arising from the S-matrix Bootstrap. Dr Aditi Sen De presented the third webinar held on the 30th January 2022. She spoke about recent developments in quantum technology. She talked about revolutionary inventions in the field of quantum communication and computation and a few results in quantum technology design.<br><br><br><h3>Hackathon</h3>Hackathon is an event where a large number of participants engage in computer programming. A hackathon based on atmospheric and climate science was organized on 29th January 2022, under the guidance of Dr Anand Narayan Sarma. The questions involved predicting carbon dioxide levels throughout 2022, calculating the average ocean temperature, and finding correlations between different climate markers using real-world data. It required very basic programming skills to participate and consisted of questions that could be solved with a preliminary understanding of Data Science. The hackathon was held over Discord, and registration was free as well as open to everyone. A total of 30 teams from across India registered for the hackathon, which included teams from prestigious institutes like Chennai Mathematical Institute, Vellore Institute of Technology, North-Eastern University, BMS College of Engineering, and IISER Pune. The participants were briefed on the rules, and the problem statements were shared. They were given 6 hours to solve the questions and submit their solutions. The deadline for the answer submission was 4:30 pm, but it was postponed by 30 minutes due to a high volume of requests for extension. The best five teams were asked to present their solution, and questions were asked by Dr Sarma and other participants. The top three teams were then declared. First position: Winter-Coders (Aparajita Sen, Shakul Awasthi — IISER TVM) Second position shared by: Protocol112 (Krishna Kumar, Gaurav Seal, Ashutosh Kumar — IISER TVM) Theja and Comrades (Sijil, Abhinand, Amjad — IISER TVM) Many participants applauded the organisers for the quality and instructive nature of the questions. They expressed their interest to take part in similar events in the future.<br><br><br><h3>eSports - Space Race to Duna</h3>In the game, players direct a nascent space program, staffed and crewed by green humanoid aliens known as "Kerbals". The game features a realistic orbital physics engine, allowing for various real-life orbital manoeuvres such as Hohmann transfer orbits and orbital rendezvous. The objective of the game was kept simple. Each team had to build a look spacecraft and fly it to a planet named DUNA, representing our real-life Mars. Registration was open to everyone from 21st to 24th January. Tutorials for installing the game, basic controls, and a model launch were given to registered participants. A total of 41 teams registered for the contest. This included teams from IIT Kharagpur, IISER Mohali, IISER Pune, IISER Bhopal, IGDTUW New Delhi, UBKV West Bengal, etc. 13 teams were able to land their spacecraft successfully. Two teams with the least cost were chosen as winners and runners-up.<ol><li>First Prize: Jebediah Aerospace Pvt. Ltd.
